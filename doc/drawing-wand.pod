DrawTranslate() applies a translation to the current coordinate system which moves the coordinate system origin to the specified coordinate.- wand: the drawing wand. - x: new x ordinate for coordinate system origin - y: new y ordinate for coordinate system origin

DrawSetViewbox() sets the overall canvas size to be recorded with the drawing vector data.  Usually this will be specified using the same size as the canvas image.  When the vector data is saved to SVG or MVG formats, the viewbox is use to specify the size of the canvas image that a viewer will render the vector data on.- wand: the drawing wand. - x1: left x ordinate - y1: top y ordinate - x2: right x ordinate - y2: bottom y ordinate

IsDrawingWand() returns MagickTrue if the wand is verified as a drawing wand.- wand: the drawing wand.

NewDrawingWand() returns a drawing wand required for all other methods in the API.<h2><a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/api/MagickWand/drawing-wand_8c.html" id="PeekDrawingWand">PeekDrawingWand</a></h2>PeekDrawingWand() returns the current drawing wand.The format of the PeekDrawingWand method is:<pre class="text">DrawInfo \*PeekDrawingWand(const DrawingWand \*wand)</pre>- wand: the drawing wand.

    sub PopDrawingWand(

    )
    returns uint32 
    is native(&library)
    is export { * };

PopDrawingWand() destroys the current drawing wand and returns to the previously pushed drawing wand. Multiple drawing wands may exist. It is an error to attempt to pop more drawing wands than have been pushed, and it is proper form to pop all drawing wands which have been pushed.- wand: the drawing wand.

    sub PushDrawingWand(

    is native(&library)
    is export { * };

PushDrawingWand() clones the current drawing wand to create a new drawing wand.  The original drawing wand(s) may be returned to by invoking PopDrawingWand().  The drawing wands are stored on a drawing wand stack. For every Pop there must have already been an equivalent Push.- wand: the drawing wand.
